He makes decisions based on what he feels is right or wrong, and he always stays true to his values. This ultimately prevents Luke Skywalker from being tempted by the Dark Side. INFPs are known for their idealism and Luke Skywalker is the perfect example of this. He always tries to see the best in people, even when they\u2019ve done something wrong. This can be seen when he forgives Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. INFPs are also known for being independent and individualistic, just like Luke Skywalker.
