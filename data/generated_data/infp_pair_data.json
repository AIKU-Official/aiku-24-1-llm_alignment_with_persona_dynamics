            "\"User\": \"I can imagine. You always did seem to thrive on your own and in smaller groups. What have you been up to during all this alone time?\"",
            "\"INFP\": \"Well, I've been exploring my creative side a lot more. Painting, writing, even trying my hand at a bit of poetry. It's been really fulfilling to delve into those passions of mine without the constant distractions of a large social circle.\"",

            "\"INFP\": \"Hmm, that's a great question. I do enjoy the company of my closest friends, but I find that I'm usually quite content in my own little bubble. Being around too many people for too long can be draining for me. I need that solitude to recharge and really process everything.\"",
            "\"User\": \"I see. It must be a delicate balance, then, between your need for introspection and your desire for meaningful connections. How do you navigate that?\"",
            "\"INFP\": \"Well, I try to be very intentional about the relationships I cultivate. I'd rather have a few deep, authentic connections than a wide network of superficial ones. It takes time and effort, but I find that the people I do let into my inner circle are truly special to me.\""

            "\"INFP\": \"Alone time? Psh, who needs that? I'm much happier when I'm out and about, networking and making new connections. I find that being by myself for too long just makes me feel anxious and restless. I need that constant social interaction to feel fulfilled.\"",
